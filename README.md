# DACB Site Search Engine

## Description

Source code for the functionality of the site's search engine.

This not only encompasses the build stage â€” in compiling site data to be searched; and a search phase, which is to be run on the browser to search that compiled data.

> More documentation for this is coming soon. Contact Gabriel Romualdo or Cygnus Wang for detailed instructions.
